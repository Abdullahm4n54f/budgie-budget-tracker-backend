# Budgie - AI-Generated Personal Budget Tracker

**Team Members:** Abdullah Mansaf, Malik Habib ur Rehman

**Competition:** Vibe Coding - Build Track (October 2025)

## Description

Budgie is a full-stack personal budget tracking web application designed for simplicity and visual clarity. It helps users manage income and expenses effectively.

**Crucially, this entire project was developed by providing prompts to Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model.** Following the competition's "no manual code edits" rule, all code (React frontend, Flask backend, SQL schema, CSS styling, debugging solutions) was generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro and directly copy-pasted into the project files in VS Code.

The application uses React/TypeScript (styled with Tailwind CSS/shadcn/ui) for the frontend, a Flask/Python API for the backend, and MySQL for data persistence.

## Features (UI/Logic Primarily Generated via Gemini 2.5 Pro)

* **Transaction Logging:** Easily add income or expense. Select a category (like 'Food' üçî or 'Salary' üíº), enter the amount, choose the date (past dates allowed!), and add an optional note.
    * *(Example: User clicks the '+' button, selects 'Coffee' ‚òï, enters 5.00, keeps today's date, and clicks 'Add Transaction'. The balance updates instantly.)*

* **Balance & Monthly Summary:** See your overall current balance at a glance. The dashboard card also clearly shows total income and total expenses accumulated within the **current calendar month**.
    * *(Example: The main card shows an overall balance of PKR 50,000. Below, it might show "+PKR 75,000" income and "-PKR 10,000" expenses for October.)*

* **Recent Activity:** The home page displays your 5 most recent transactions, showing category, date, note, and amount for quick reference.
    * *(Example: After adding a 'Rent' expense, it appears at the top of the 'Recent Activity' list.)*

* **Transaction History & Deletion:** View a complete, scrollable history of all transactions in a modal, sorted newest first. Permanently delete any transaction with a click, which automatically updates all related totals (balance, budget, analytics).
    * *(Example: User opens 'History', finds an accidental duplicate entry, clicks the trash icon next to it, confirms, and the entry disappears.)*

* **Budget Tracking:** Set a monthly expense budget in the Analytics section. Track progress on the home page via an expandable "Budget" card featuring:
    * A progress bar showing the percentage of the current month's budget used (turns red ‚ù§Ô∏è when over budget).
    * A breakdown of spending by category for the current month (% of total spending shown).
    * *(Example: With a PKR 20,000 budget, after spending PKR 5,000 on 'Groceries' and PKR 3,000 on 'Fuel', the bar shows 40% used. The list shows 'Groceries: PKR 5,000 (62.5% of spending)', 'Fuel: PKR 3,000 (37.5% of spending)'.)*

* **Financial Analytics Modal:** Access charts for deeper insights:
    * **Overview:** Compare current month's income vs. expenses side-by-side (bar chart) and see their distribution (pie chart).
    * **Categories:** See which expense categories you spent the most on this month (vertical bar chart with colored bars).
    * **Budget:** Visualize how this month's spending breaks down against your budget (pie/donut chart including 'Remaining' or 'Over Budget'). Set your monthly budget here.
    * **Monthly:** Track income vs. expense trends over the last 6 months (line chart).
    * *(Example: User opens 'Analytics' and selects 'Monthly' to see if their income has been consistently higher than expenses over the past few months.)*

* **"AI" Insights (Rule-Based):** Get simple, automated financial observations on the home page based on your current month's data (e.g., high savings rate, top spending category, budget status, spending frequency). **Disclaimer:** These are generated via predefined logic programmed by Gemini 2.5 Pro, not a live LLM call.
    * *(Example: The insight might read: "‚ö†Ô∏è You're spending 15% more than you earn. Review your expenses to avoid debt.")*

* **Settings Customization:** Personalize your experience via the settings modal:
    * Change the display username shown in the greeting ("Hi, Abdullah!").
    * Select your preferred currency symbol ($, ¬£, Rs., Ô∑º, ÿØ.ÿ•, ¬•) applied everywhere amounts are shown.
    * *(Example: User goes to settings, selects 'PKR', and clicks save. All '$' signs change to 'Rs.'.)*

* **Recurring Transactions (UI):** For common regular transactions (Salary, Rent, Subscriptions, etc.), a checkbox appears to mark them as recurring. (Note: Automatic addition logic is a basic client-side placeholder).
    * *(Example: User adds their monthly 'Rent' expense and checks the 'Make recurring?' box.)*

* **UI/UX:** Features a modern dark theme with vibrant gradient accents, a custom app logo, a responsive mobile-first layout, and custom-styled scrollbars for a clean look.
    * *(Example: The app looks consistent and easy to use whether viewed on a narrow mobile screen or a wider desktop browser.)*

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Recharts, Axios, date-fns
* **Backend:** Flask, Python, mysql-connector-python, Flask-CORS, python-dotenv
* **Database:** MySQL
* **AI Assistants:**
    * **Lovable.dev:** Used for initial project scaffolding and file generation.
    * **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro:** Used for ~90% of development, including component creation, styling, backend logic, API integration, SQL queries, and extensive debugging.
* **Development Tools:** VS Code, Git, GitHub, Node.js/npm, Python/pip

## LLM Usage (Lovable & Gemini 2.5 Pro)

This project strictly followed the Vibe Coding competition rule of **no manual code edits** after the initial scaffolding phase.

1.  **Initial Scaffolding:** The base React/Tailwind/shadcn file structure and some initial placeholder components were generated using **Lovable.dev**. The chat history for this phase can be found here:
    * **[Link to Lovable Chat History - Optional, if you have it]** _(<- Add link if available)_
2.  **Core Development & Iteration (Gemini 2.5 Pro):** After Lovable credits expired, **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro** was used for approximately 90% of the subsequent development and debugging via direct copy-pasting of generated code into VS Code. This included:
    * Generating/modifying React components (`.tsx`).
    * Implementing frontend logic, state management, and API calls (Axios).
    * Applying styling (Tailwind CSS, gradients, fonts).
    * Building the entire Flask backend API (`app.py`), including database connection logic and environment variable setup.
    * Writing all API endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) and corresponding SQL queries.
    * **Debugging:** All errors encountered (CORS, NaN/Decimal conversion, type errors, calculation mistakes, UI bugs, Git issues, etc.) were resolved by describing the issue to Gemini 2.5 Pro and implementing the code changes it provided.
3.  **Process:** Code provided by the AI was copy-pasted directly, replacing existing code blocks entirely. No manual typing or tweaking occurred in the code files.
4.  **Gemini Prompts Record:** Detailed history of prompts given to Gemini 2.5 Pro:

## Development Process & Challenges (Solved with AI)

* **Transition:** Moved from Lovable structure to local VS Code setup using Gemini's guidance (Node, Python `venv`, Git).
* **Full-Stack Build:** Built Flask backend, MySQL schema (`schema.sql` generated via prompts), and API connections entirely via prompts to Gemini 2.5 Pro.
* **CORS:** Solved cross-origin errors by prompting Gemini for the `Flask-CORS` solution.
* **Data Types:** Fixed `NaN` errors by prompting Gemini to add `float()` conversions for `Decimal` types in Flask. Corrected number formatting in React via prompts (`formatCurrency` function).
* **Logic Errors:** Debugged issues like incorrect monthly totals on the Balance Card and flawed AI Insight comparisons through iterative prompting. Ensured analytics/budget components correctly filter data by month.
* **UI Bugs:** Fixed invisible buttons, font application (`font-grand-hotel`, then reverted), layout issues, scrollbar styling (`tailwind-scrollbar`), and date picker styling hints through prompts. Replaced a broken budget pie chart with a functional progress bar via prompts.
* **Git & Environment:** Used Gemini for Git commands (`init`, config, remote, push), `.gitignore` setup, Python `venv`, and dependency conflict resolution (`tailwind-scrollbar` version). Ensured secure password handling using `.env` files via prompts.

## Local Setup Instructions

**Why Local Setup?** This is a full-stack application. Deployment was not required for the "Build" track. Follow these steps carefully to run it on your machine.

**Prerequisites:**

* [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.8+, added to PATH)
* [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) (v8.0+)
* MySQL client tool (e.g., MySQL Workbench)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone Repositories:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Abdullahm4n54f/budgie-budget-tracker-frontend.git](https://github.com/Abdullahm4n54f/budgie-budget-tracker-frontend.git)
    git clone [https://github.com/Abdullahm4n54f/budgie-budget-tracker-backend.git](https://github.com/Abdullahm4n54f/budgie-budget-tracker-backend.git)
    ```

2.  **Setup MySQL Database:**
    * Ensure your MySQL server is running.
    * Connect as `root` user using MySQL Workbench (or similar).
    * Execute the following SQL commands (copied from `schema.sql` in the backend repo):
        ```sql
        USE budgie_db; -- Creates if not exists implicitly via schema file usually, but USE ensures context

        CREATE TABLE transactions (
            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            user_id VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'default_user',
            type ENUM('income', 'expense') NOT NULL,
            category VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
            amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
            note TEXT,
            transaction_date DATE NOT NULL,
            created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
        );

        CREATE TABLE settings (
            setting_id INT PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT 1,
            user_id VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'default_user',
            username VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'User',
            currency_symbol VARCHAR(5) DEFAULT '$',
            monthly_budget DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 0,
            CONSTRAINT settings_pk CHECK (setting_id = 1)
        );

        INSERT INTO settings (user_id) VALUES ('default_user');

        CREATE TABLE recurring_transactions (
            id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
            user_id VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT 'default_user',
            type ENUM('income', 'expense') NOT NULL,
            category VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
            amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
            note TEXT,
            day_of_month INT NOT NULL,
            last_added_date DATE NULL,
            created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
            CONSTRAINT check_day CHECK (day_of_month >= 1 AND day_of_month <= 31)
        );

        ALTER TABLE transactions ADD INDEX idx_user_date (user_id, transaction_date);
        ALTER TABLE recurring_transactions ADD INDEX idx_user_day (user_id, day_of_month);
        ```

3.  **Setup Backend:**
    * Open a terminal in the `budgie-budget-tracker-backend` folder.
    * Create & Activate venv:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        # Windows:
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        # Mac/Linux:
        # source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    * **Configure DB Password:**
        * Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
        * **Edit `.env`** and replace `YOUR_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD_HERE` with your **local MySQL root password**.
    * Run server: `python app.py`
        * *(API will run at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`)*

4.  **Setup Frontend:**
    * Open a **new, separate terminal**.
    * Navigate to the *inner* frontend folder: `cd budgie-budget-tracker-frontend/gradient-cents-main`
    * Install dependencies: `npm install`
    * Run server: `npm run dev`
        * *(App URL like `http://localhost:8080` will appear in terminal)*

5.  **Access App:** Open the frontend `localhost` URL from step 4 in your browser.

## Performance Notes / Known Issues

* **Performance:** Runs well locally. Initial data load depends on backend response time.
* **Recurring Transactions:** Basic client-side check on load; not a robust background system. Needs `localStorage` or backend logic for full persistence and accuracy across sessions/missed months.
* **Date Input Icon:** Standard `<input type="date">` icon might be dark in dark mode on some browsers.
* **Scalability:** Uses direct DB connections; connection pooling recommended for production. No user authentication implemented.
